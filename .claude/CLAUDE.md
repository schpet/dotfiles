for all version control operations use jj (jj-vcs) instead of git. note for read only operations, use `--ignore-working-copy`. when reviewing diffs with jj, use the `--git` flag for easier to understand output. when committing work, always use `jj ci` or `jj describe ... && jj new` to ensure future work is on a new commit. squash things into previous commits as appropriate.
